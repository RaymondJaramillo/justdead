## Description 

We all have a loved one who thinks the worst whenever we don't answer the 
phone. Justdead is an app that would let the people closest to you know that your phone 
is  Justdead, not you. Justdead would send a text and last known location to 
the people you have selected, before your phone dies. You can select a percentage, 
customized message and a list of people you would like your message to be sent to 
and then Justdead will automatically do the rest. 
Justdead will let your loved ones worry a little less.

## Intended users

* Parents who worry when children don't answer the phone.

* A spouse who wants to let loved ones know that their phone is close to dying.
