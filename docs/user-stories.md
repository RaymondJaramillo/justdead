* As a parent with children who are always out of the house and also on their phones, I want a way to know that their phone is dying with out relying on them to tell me. 

* As a husband with a worried wife, I want to make sure that even if I can't get a hold of my family they know why and where I last was.

* As a forgetful person living my own, I want to make sure that if my phone is dead loved ones know why they can't get a hold of me and have my last known location.
